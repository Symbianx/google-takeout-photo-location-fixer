# Google Takeout Photo Location Fixer

This Go tool uses the Google Takeout location information to add GPS data to pictures without without a location.

It works by looking at the time the picture was taken and using the location data to determine your location at the time.


## Requirements

You must download and install Phil Harvey's exiftool binary from https://exiftool.org/.


## Running the tool

Download the tool from the [latest GitHub release](https://github.com/Symbianx/google-takeout-photo-location-fixer/releases).

This command will run the tool process all `.jpg` files in the `sample_data` directory using the location history in `./sample_data/Location\ History/Records.json`:
```shell
google-takeout-photo-location-fixer -d ./sample_data -f ./sample_data/Location\ History/Records.json
```

If you get an error about not finding the exiftool in the $PATH, you can use the `--exiftool-binary` argument to pass it's location:
```shell
google-takeout-photo-location-fixer  --exiftool-binary /home/Symbianx/Downloads/exiftool -d ./sample_data -f ./sample_data/Location\ History/Records.json
```

To get a list of all available options run:
```shell
google-takeout-photo-location-fixer --help
```
